title: Beautiful Web Type&#58; Finding the Gems in Google Web Fonts

Google Web Fonts is filled with crummy display faces and incomplete families. There are however, some gems; they're just really hard to find. Chad Mazzola:

> There are over 400 typefaces in the Google web fonts directory. Many of them are awful. But there are also high-quality typefaces that deserve a closer look.

Chad put together this---beautifully typeset---site as an example of what can be done with typefaces found on Google Web Fonts. Clicking on any example takes you straight to the page where you can grab the code to use each font.

I found all the fonts for [Style Manual][] using this.
