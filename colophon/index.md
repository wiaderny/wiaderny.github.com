This site is built with [Jekyll], a blog aware, static site generator, and hosted on [GitHub]. The source code is version controlled with [Git] and stored on [GitHub].

All the content is written in [Markdown]; [John Gruber]'s excellent text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers.

It is typeset in [Proxima Nova Light], a beautiful typeface, and [Courier New]. The design is heavily based on the fantastic work of the guys behind [Medium], a service that I emphatically recommend.

The homepage features various images which are all licensed under a Creative Commons License. In particular, the homepage randomly displays one of the following images: The London Shard and City Hall, a photograph by [Nathan Meijer], the Uluwatu Temple in Bali, a photograph taken by [Sean McGrath] and the Matterhorn and Ägerisee, both photographs by [Juan Rubiano].


**A few words about web standards**

Web standards are important, and this site adheres to them utilizing a mobile first, responsive methodology. Specifically, its HTML markup should validate as [HTML5], and ts layout is constructed using valid [CSS]; not regarding the proprietary attributes, which will most likely not validate.

If this site looks goofy in your browser, you are most likely using a useless browser that doesn’t support web standards. Internet Explorer, I’m looking in your direction. Please do not complain about this. If, however, you are using a modern, standards-compliant browser and have trouble viewing or reading this website, please do let me know.
