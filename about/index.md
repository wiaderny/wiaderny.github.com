I'm Jonah, a 25-year-old graduate student of banking and financial management at the University of Liechtenstein and entrepreneur. I like typography, photographing and sushi.

Every once in a while I am also around on [Google+], [Twitter], [Flickr] and [LinkedIn]. My email address is <owner@wiaderny.org>. For additional privacy you may want to consider my [PGP key](../assets/data/wiaderny.asc).
