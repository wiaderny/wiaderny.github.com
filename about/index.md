I'm Jonah, a 25-year-old graduate student of banking and financial management at the University of Liechtenstein and entrepreneur. Previously, I attended the University of Halle-Wittenberg in Germany and fulfilled the requirements for receiving a Bachelor of Science in Economics. Beside my obvious interest for banking, finance and investing I like spending time hunting for beautiful typography, improving my humble javascript skills, taking photographs and eating sushi.

Every once in a while I am also around on [Google+], [Twitter], [Flickr] and [LinkedIn] and I would love to connect with you. If you have any questions, suggestions, or would like to say hello, please do so using my email address, which is <owner@wiaderny.org>. For additional privacy you may want to consider my [PGP key](../assets/data/wiaderny.asc).
