I'm Jonah, a 29-year-old banking and financial management graduate of the University of Liechtenstein and Managing Partner of [Jonah Levi Diamanten]. Previously, I attended the University of Halle-Wittenberg in Germany and fulfilled the requirements for receiving a Bachelor of Science in Economics. Beside my obvious interest in banking, particularly corporate finance and private banking, I like spending time hunting for beautiful typography, improving my humble coding skills, taking photographs and working out.

Every once in a while I am also around on [Twitter] and [LinkedIn] and I would love to connect with you. If you have any questions, suggestions, or would like to say hello, please do so using my email address, which is <owner@wiaderny.org>. For additional privacy you may want to consider my [PGP key](../assets/data/wiaderny.asc).
